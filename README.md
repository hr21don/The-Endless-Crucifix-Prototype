# The-Endless-Crucifix

## Inspiration 
Endless games are enjoyed by people of all ages. My interest in game development started back in 
college where I was tasked with making a short 30s trailer for my 3d SteamPunk game which was fun 
during the development process up to the final artefact. This game was made using the IDE on Unity 
3d that uses c# for the programming language.

## Motivation
Making a game last long is challenging enough where making it last forever is my motivation for this 
project idea.
